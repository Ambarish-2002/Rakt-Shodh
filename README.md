Today, most medical care depends on a steady supply of blood from donors, as one in seven people entering the hospital needs blood.
When any patient requires blood, the hospital makes use of the blood stored in the hospital or requests different blood banks for blood but in cases of emergency, if the hospital fails to arrange blood for the patient, it requests the relatives of the patient to try and arrange it furthermore if the blood type is rare, it becomes nearby impossible to procure it in time.
This website has following features:

1) Display real-time data of available blood stock of nearby blood banks

2) Option to request blood

<h3>Details:</h3>

1) Display real-time data of available blood stock of nearby blood banks:

2) Option to request blood:
If matching blood is not available in nearby blood banks, we can make request by entering patient details and requirement in our website. Will send SMS to all people who are in same city and having matching blood type. For the same we will need data of each and every personâ€™s blood group, phone number and address. We can get this data by making a compulsory update of Aadhar card by linking blood group. So, our method will have a wider reach than the conventional method followed by blood banks of contacting few known matching blood type donors. In this way by contacting all people whether they have donated blood or not we can create awareness and give opportunity to them for donating first time.

3) Organizing blood donation camp:
We can arrange blood donation camp for rare blood groups by sending SMS using our smart targeted messaging technology.

4) Blood bank directory:
It will provide contact information of all blood banks .
